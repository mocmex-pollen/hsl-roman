# `roman`

Template repository for HSL competition.

**Please _do not fork this repository directly on GitHub._**  Instead, please use GitHub's "template" function following [the instructions below](#creating-a-repository) to copy this repository and customize it for your project.

## Using this Repository

This repo provides test cases you can use to verify that your code submission works correctly.

If you are working with a fakeship, this is one way to set things up for rapid development:

1. Start a fakeship and `|mount %base`.
2. Clone this repo into the same directory as the fakeship, then copy the contents of `src/` into `zod/base/`.
3. Develop either in `zod/base/` or in this repo folder directly.  It's probably a bit easier to develop in the fakeship and copy back here frequently.

Caveat:  The `.gitkeep` files should be removed once you have something in that directory, as Clay won't have a mark for them.

## Creating a Repository

1.  Log in to GitHub.
    (If you do not have an account, you can quickly create one for free.)
    You must be logged in for the remaining steps to work.

2.  On this page (<https://github.com/hoon-school/template-roman/>),
    click on the green "Use this template" button (top right)

3.  Select the owner for your new repository.
    (This will probably be you, but may instead be an organization you belong to.)

4.  Choose a name for your copy of the archetype repository.
    This name should have the form of the template repo without `archetype`, e.g. `roman` or `hsl-roman`.

5.  Make sure the repository is **private**, leave "Include all branches" unchecked, and click
on "Create repository from template".
You will be redirected to your new copy of the template respository.

6.  You should share the repo with your competition's submission lead as identified on the submission form.

After this is complete, you can use this repo to handle your competition development and submission.
